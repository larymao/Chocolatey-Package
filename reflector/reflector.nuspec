Look inside any .NET code

Debug your application

Follow bugs through your application to see where the problem is â€“ your own code, third-party libraries, or components used by your application.
Understand how applications work

Inherited an application with no documentation and no comments? Use .NET Reflector to understand how the code runs and avoid bugs.
Look inside APIs, SharePoint, and other third-party platforms

Third-party platforms aren't always well-documented. Use .NET Reflector to look inside their assemblies, and see how they work and which APIs you can call.
Try it now, choose your version later.
